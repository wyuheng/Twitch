# Twitch+: A Personalized Twitch Resources Recommendation Engine

* This is a full-stack web application for users to search twitch resources (stream/video/clip) and get recommendations. 
* I have Implemented RESTful APIs using Java servlets, retrieved real Twitch resources using Twitch API and stored data in MySQL.
* I Improved personalized recommendation by applying content-based recommendation algorithm to the system.

#### I have deployed the service to AWS EC2 for better stability. The demo is accessible through this link <a href="http://54.175.130.159" target="_blank">Twitch Interface</a>.
